# odin_recipes
This is my first Odin Project

The project demonstrates my understanding of the following HTML Concepts:
- HTML Boilerplate: I discovered a shortcut for generating the boilerplate (! then tab) 
- Various text elements
- Lists 
- Links (Absolute and relative) and images
- Git basics and messages: my first attempt at staging and making commits.  

Finally it will also be my first foray into git.
