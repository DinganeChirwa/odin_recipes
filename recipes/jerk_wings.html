    <h3>Smoked Jerk Chicken Wings with Honey-Tamarind Dipping Sauce</h3>

    <!-- The paragraph has been displayed in more than one line for readability -->
    <p>This fragrant and spicy jerk marinade gives an instant shot of Jamaican flavor to these smoky wings. 
        Pimento wood, which comes from the allspice tree, provides the unique smoke flavor of Jamaican jerk chicken. 
        The unique flavor of the wood really has no exact substitute but apple and pecan wood 
        are often suggested as an acceptable substitute. Stay away from stronger woods such as hickory or mesquite as 
        those woods will overpower the flavor of the jerk marinade. The tart tamarind melts into 
        mellow honey smooth dipping sauce making these an instant tailgating classic.</p>

    <h4>Steps/Directions</h4>
    <h5>For the smoked chicken wings:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Brush the chicken with canola oil. Combine the sugar, allspice, chile, black pepper 
            and salt. Generously coat the chicken with the spice mix.</li>
        <li>Heat the grill to medium for indirect grilling. Add the chips to the coals or put in 
            a smoke box and add to the grill. Place the chicken on the grill over medium heat, and 
            cook until golden browned and crisp, about 5 minutes. Cover the grill. Grill until the 
            chicken is brown and crisp and just cooked through, about 10 minutes. 
            Remove from grill and place the chicken in a large bowl. </li>      
    </ol>

    <h5>For the honey tamarind sauce:</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine 1/2 cup water, the orange juice, honey, ketchup, tamarind and ginger in a small 
            saucepan and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium and cook until slightly thick, 
            about 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and remove and discard the ginger. 
            Season with salt and pepper. Whisk in the vinegar. Keep warm. </li>
        <li>Add the honey-tamarind dipping sauce to the bowl of chicken and toss to coat. Sprinkle 
            with salt and transfer to a platter.</li>
    </ol>
