    <h3>Smoked Jerk Chicken Wings with Honey-Tamarind Dipping Sauce</h3>

    <p>This fragrant and spicy jerk marinade gives an instant shot of Jamaican flavor to these smoky wings. Pimento wood, which comes from the allspice tree, provides the unique smoke flavor of Jamaican jerk chicken. Hard to find in the US, the unique flavor of the wood really has no exact substitute but apple and pecan wood are often suggested as an acceptable substitute. Stay away from stronger woods such as hickory or mesquite as those woods will overpower the flavor of the jerk marinade. The tart tamarind melts into mellow honey smooth dipping sauce making these an instant tailgating classic.</p>
