        Jollof rice is a popular West African dish, known for its rich and flavorful blend of rice,

        marinated in a blend of spices and then simmered with the rice and vegetables until everything 
        is cooked to perfection. The result is a fragrant and delicious one-pot meal that is sure to 
        satisfy any appetite. The chicken adds a savory and tender element to the dish, complementing 
        the complex flavors of the rice and spices. Jollof rice with chicken is a perfect representation

    <!-- Cooking Directions -->
    <h4>Steps/Directions:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
        <li>
            Season the chicken drumsticks with salt, black pepper, 1 tsp of dried thyme, and 1 tsp of curry powder. Heat the 
            cooking oil in a large, oven-safe pot or Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Add the chicken drumsticks and cook 
            until browned on all sides, about 5-7 minutes. Remove the chicken from the pot and set it aside on a plate.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the diced onions, minced garlic, and minced ginger to the same pot and sauté until the onions are translucent, 
            about 2-3 minutes. Add the chopped scotch bonnet peppers (or other hot peppers), the remaining dried thyme, curry 
            powder, smoked paprika, and ground cinnamon, and stir for another minute or two.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the tomato paste and canned diced tomatoes to the pot, and stir until everything is well combined. Pour in the 
            chicken broth or water, and season with salt and black pepper to taste.
        </li>
        <li>
            Stir in the uncooked rice, making sure it's well coated with the sauce. Add any optional vegetables at this point if 
            using. Arrange the browned chicken drumsticks on top of the rice mixture.
        </li>
        <li>
            Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid or foil, and transfer it to the preheated oven. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until 
            the rice is tender and the chicken is cooked through.
        </li>
        <li>
            Remove the pot from the oven and let it rest for a few minutes before removing the lid. Fluff the rice with a fork and 
            garnish with chopped parsley or cilantro if desired.
        </li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>

    <strong>Note:</strong>
    <em>
        Cooking times may vary depending on your oven and the size of your chicken drumsticks, so make sure to check that the chicken 
        is fully cooked before serving.
